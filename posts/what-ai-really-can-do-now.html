        <div class="post-title">What AI Really Can Do Now</div>
        <p>I read an article from The Newsweek that is called "What AI Really Can Do Now" and explores what Artificial Intelligence is actually better suited for. Articles like that give hope to us mere mortals that AI will not actually take over people's jobs and we - students, still have a chance of getting a job on the bleeding job market.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
<li>AI is augmentation - not automation;</li>
<li>People have to be in control in order to accept the new tech. </li>
<li>People are better suited for precise work and AI is for creative collaboration</li>
</ul>
        <br>
        <p>In my opinion augmentation of AI is the future of our everyday life. I can only dream of an Artificial Intelligence like Jarvis from Ironman movies. It is having a companion that knows everything about you and therefore able to help in every aspect of your life. Imagine a personal doctor that monitors your health, a personal gym coach that personalizing your training to fit you, a work assistant handling the monotonous tasks and all rolled into one. This AI would clear so much in my life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Of course I see the flip side of this coin - loss of personal try-fail-succeed loop of individual growth of each one of us. It would definitely change how humans interact with each other, perceive the world and experience it. For example, this machine assistant would probably be determining our life in some way. If this AI is our stability, it would probably limit us in order to "protect", but by the cost of our natural curiosity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If more Artificial Intelligence means less Natural Intelligence then I'm definitely against it. I don't want to be held back by technology that is comfortable and convenient. Curiosity is what made us humans so unique - why lose that?</p>
