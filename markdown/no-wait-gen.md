# No-wait-gen.

We got too comfortable. Every day we use lots of services and expect from them to be as easy and fast to use as possible. Moreover, new generation lives in a time when a message is delivered in milliseconds, we can make it around the world in days and get our packages in weeks. We don't like to wait and we're not used to that. 
As a matter of fact, I got this thought when I registered on some website and I didn't get my email immediately after. It really bothered me in the moment. But was that a long wait? No, just a minute longer. I don't even understand why I'd let this thing captivate my mind for that long. I was not in a rush, this service wasn't really so important and still 3I was irritated. 
We got used to getting the information in a glance and now even small anticipation is killing us.
