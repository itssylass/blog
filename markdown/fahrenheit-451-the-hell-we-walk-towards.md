# Fahrenheit 451: The Hell We Walk Towards 

Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is not a prediction of society's future as many of the readers saw it, but Bradbury's attempt to prevent it from happening. A future of an illiterate, stupid herd of animals driven only by instinct, hiding from reality and themselves. The worst kind of hell is the one that people gratefully walk towards.

The main character of the story - Guy Montag - is a fireman that in the same is hot, like the fire he brings into people's homes and cold, like the books, calm and curious of experiencing and understanding. He is stretched between those two ideologies. His metamorphosis started long before the first pages of the book. He had been stealing book from burning houses and hiding them in his own. That shows what side he is really on before he even chooses. He snaps during a crucial event. He begins to accept what he had done, the moment Captain Beatty steps in.

Captain Beatty is the chief of Montag's firemen station. He stands solid for ideals of the Fire Salamander, although he is not just someone that had been said to believe in the new system. As a fireman he also got access to books and like Guy he read them. He appears intellectual and well-read person as he throws quotes and poems at Montag and that is the most terrifying part. He saw the other side of things. He saw and understood what the books are talking about and yet chose the soft lies of his world. He is Guy Montag who chose to burn books. He was given a choice and he chose fire with all his heart. 

People like Captain Beatty build this world by using people's natural desire for comfort over truth and their conflict to remove that from them, to bring control over them and so called "peace". 

Seventy years after its publication Fahrenheit 451 remains a brutal mirror of reality we live in. While Montag's journey should inspire us, we must be warned of not to become Captain Beatty in the end. The true terror of Bradbury's piece is not that people burn the books, but do not see the point in reading them.
